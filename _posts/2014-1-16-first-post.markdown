SRE can now be found at <https://github.com/Sumbeard/sre> and it can in fact be compiled using GCC. At this point it's a partial C++11 wrapper for GLFW (<http://glfw.org>). The test program `testWindow.cpp` displays a single triangle in a window and initiates a separate thread for console input. That's all for now.
